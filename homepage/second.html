          <p class = "indent">I made the commitment this school year to learn how to get to school by train. I learned what stops to get off from, and what trains got me to school. The J train at Delancey st Essex st is where I get off and complete my mission. But there is someone who stops me everytime. A homeless person. It is not like I never knew about homelessness,It is just I never felt so close to someone so displaced before. The Station does not make it easy for me either. It was created to test me. It is  not a coincidence the door I have to go through faces the man I'm ignoring. Nor is it the train itself that goes opposite from him. It is only me being stagnant. So I do what any New Yorker would have done. I left the J train and went about my day because I'm a new yorker. </p>
          <p  class = "indent" >To anyone else my actions might seem to come from depravity. Only someone with no goodness in their heart would ignore a homeless person! But I can assure you that is not it. Living in this city gave us a certain demeanor. Our very actions can only be identified by fellow city goers. Only a Newyorker can see a man lying on the streets clearly distressed with the woes of being homeless and still traverse that very road as if these people were mere advertisements for products they never cared about. Only a New yorker can hear a car accident has happened on the jackie robinson parkway and instead of remorse for the victim they feel a slight resentment to the perpetrator for being the reason they are late to work. Only a New yorker can hear about subway gower getting attacked and treating business as usual and sliding their metrocard into turnstyle to begin their day.  </p>
          <p class = "indent">This self centered nature is what defines us but that is not the whole story. It would be cruel to only see us as self centered without recognizing where we are coming from. New Yorkers have a drive to make the most out of New York. If you lived in New York you would know it is  not our fault. Would you really blame us if you lived here too? In this great city I can see the grandiose buildings erected from an era we had no memories of.These monoliths all lined up on the street. The sheer stature of them is almost a taunt to those who wish to inhabit them. In this great city you will find any means of transportation suitable. Whether car, bike,train, cab,hell with it even walking the city knows where you go and is built so you end up where you belong. In this great city you will find locals you attach yourselves to. The deli that always greets you and your friends with sandwiches,The train station whose trains are always just on time for you to be there just waiting on you as if your presence is a prerequisite for their departure.</p>
          <p class = "indent">I personally do not know what you want from, Why you live here, or even where you spend your time. But I know that since you live here you've been infected. Maybe New York being our star in the sky is our achilles heel. Its light may go far but it is finite. And it plays favorites. The city would rather have you be stunned by a spectacle than focus on a tragedy. For me that is the J train, the enabler of my day. It only takes me to what is “Important” and steers me away from what is not. This city draws out so many emotions from me but the weirdest one of all is numbness. </p>
